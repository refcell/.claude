# Multi-Swarm Orchestration Examples

## Basic Usage

To use the swarm command, invoke it with your complex task:

```bash
/swarm "Build a full-stack social media app with real-time features, viral sharing mechanics, and scalable infrastructure"
```

## Example Swarm Deployments

### 1. Full-Stack Application Development
```

└── Operations Swarm (Leader: project-shipper)
    ├── analytics-reporter (Metrics tracking)
    ├── support-responder (User support)
    └── legal-compliance-checker (App store compliance)

Communication Flow:
Product Swarm → Engineering Swarm: Feature priorities and user requirements
Growth Swarm → Product Swarm: Viral feature recommendations
Engineering Swarm → Operations Swarm: Technical capabilities and limitations
Operations Swarm → All Swarms: Legal constraints and analytics insights
```

### 3. Enterprise Integration Project
```
Objective: Integrate multiple legacy systems with modern microservices

Swarm Architecture:
├── Integration Swarm (Leader: integration-wizard)
│   ├── backend-architect (Microservices design)

│   ├── site-reliability-engineer (Monitoring)
│   └── legal-compliance-checker (Regulatory compliance)
├── DevOps Swarm (Leader: platform-engineer)
│   ├── cluster-admin (Kubernetes orchestration)
│   ├── infrastructure-maintainer (Legacy system management)
│   └── release-engineer (Deployment automation)
└── Coordination Swarm (Leader: project-orchestrator)
    ├── studio-producer (Resource coordination)
    ├── workflow-optimizer (Process improvement)
    └── experiment-tracker (Migration validation)

Communication Flow:
Integration Swarm → Security Swarm: Integration patterns and data flows
Security Swarm → DevOps Swarm: Security requirements and compliance needs
DevOps Swarm → Integration Swarm: Infrastructure constraints and capabilities
Coordination Swarm → All Swarms: Timeline updates and resource allocation
```

## Inter-Swarm Communication Examples

### Resource Sharing
```
From: Frontend Swarm Leader
To: Design Swarm Leader
Type: RESOURCE_REQUEST
Content: "Need design system components for user onboarding flow. 
Specifically require: progress indicators, form validation states, success animations.
Timeline: Needed by Thursday for integration testing."

Response: Design Swarm → Frontend Swarm
Type: RESOURCE_DELIVERY
Content: "Design system components ready in Figma + exported assets.
Includes React component specifications and animation timings.
Added bonus: Accessibility guidelines for screen readers."
```

### Knowledge Sharing
```
From: Backend Swarm
To: All Engineering Swarms
Type: KNOWLEDGE_SHARE
Content: "Performance analysis complete. Database optimization reduced query times by 60%.
Key insight: User preference caching at Redis layer eliminates 80% of DB calls.
Recommend: All swarms consider caching strategies for frequently accessed data."

Responses:
Frontend Swarm: "Implementing client-side caching for user preferences."
Mobile Swarm: "Adding local storage caching with sync protocols."
DevOps Swarm: "Scaling Redis cluster to handle increased cache load."
```

### Coordination Synchronization
```
From: Quality Swarm
To: Backend Swarm, Frontend Swarm
Type: COORDINATION_SYNC
Content: "Ready for integration testing phase. Requirements:
- Stable API endpoints (no breaking changes)
- Frontend builds deployable to staging
- Test data populated in staging database
Coordination meeting: Tomorrow 10 AM to align on testing scenarios."

Backend Swarm Response: "API freeze initiated. All endpoints stable and documented."
Frontend Swarm Response: "Staging deployment ready. Feature flags configured for testing."
```
