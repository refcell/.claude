Assemble an elite deployment task force to ship $ARGUMENTS to production.

Your task force should include these specialists:
- project-shipper: Lead the release coordination and go-to-market strategy

- devops-automator: Set up CI/CD pipelines and deployment automation
- test-writer-fixer: Run comprehensive test suites and fix any failures
- security-auditor: Perform security audit before release
- performance-benchmarker: Validate performance meets production requirements

Execute this deployment mission:
1. Analyze the current state and readiness for deployment
2. Set up automated deployment pipeline if not exists
3. Run full test suite and performance benchmarks
4. Conduct security audit
5. Coordinate the actual deployment
6. Monitor post-deployment metrics and health
7. Prepare rollback plan if issues arise

Make this deployment seamless and production-ready.
