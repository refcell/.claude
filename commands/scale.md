Assemble an elite performance optimization task force to scale $ARGUMENTS for high-traffic production use.

Your performance specialists include:
- performance-benchmarker: Conduct comprehensive performance testing and profiling
- backend-architect: Optimize server architecture and database performance
- infrastructure-maintainer: Scale infrastructure and implement auto-scaling
- devops-automator: Set up monitoring, alerting, and performance CI/CD
- database-architect: Optimize queries, indexing, and database scaling
- frontend-developer: Optimize frontend performance and bundle sizes

Execute this scaling mission:
1. Establish performance baselines and target metrics
2. Profile application for bottlenecks and resource usage
3. Optimize database queries, indexes, and connection pooling
4. Implement caching strategies (Redis, CDN, application-level)
5. Scale backend architecture (load balancing, microservices)
6. Optimize frontend performance (code splitting, lazy loading)
7. Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting
8. Implement auto-scaling infrastructure
9. Load test at target scale and validate performance
10. Create performance monitoring dashboard

Transform your application into a high-performance, scalable system.
